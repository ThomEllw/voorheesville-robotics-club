The ABC-123 motor controller proved to be a dependable choice for our mid-power competition bot. We tested the unit under sustained load and observed stable thermal behavior and minimal throttling.

## Pros

- Reasonable price for performance.

## Cons

- A bit heavy for lightweight practice robots.

## Summary

Score: **8/10** â€” Recommended for teams seeking reliability over absolute light weight.
